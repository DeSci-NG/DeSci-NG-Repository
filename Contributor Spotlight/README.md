# 📂 Contributor Spotlight

This folder features projects shared by contributors who believe in the mission of making research open, relevant, and impactful.

By listing their work here, they’re not just showcasing their efforts, they’re helping build a public repository of knowledge that others can learn from, build on, or collaborate with.

📝 **Before submitting**, please take a moment to review existing entries to get a sense of the ideal format and structure. This helps us maintain consistency and minimize back-and-forth during the review process.

If you'd like to have your project hosted here, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/SPZSZGsnsh1rLaF77) or reach out via info.descing@gmail.com. 

Together, we're building a research culture rooted in openness, intention, and local relevance.
